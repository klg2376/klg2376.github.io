            <h1 style="color:white">Fanworks</h1>
            <p>A very popular aspect of the Star Wars Universe is one that is
              shares with several other serie and that is the prominence of work
               produced by the fans, or "fanworks". But this raises the question
              of what exactly is a fanwork? While the obvious answer is any
            contribution to the universe that is created by the fans, it can be
          narrowed down into four categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fanfiction</li>
              <li>Fanart</li>
              <li>Fan-made videos</li>
              <li>Meta</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color:white">Fanfiction</h2>
            <p>Fanfiction is one of the well-known mediums for fanworks. It is
            exactly what the name implies, fiction about the universe written by fans,
           for fans. It is also a very versatile medium as it allows fans to explore
         aspects of the series that are not "canon" (true to the original story).
        Through fanfiction, there is a whole secondary universe of stories, relationship,
       and character interpretations that are just as intriguing as the canon universe,
    but that aren't professionally produced. Fanfiction is also easily accessible and
   can be found on the following sites:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="http://www.fanfiction.net">Fanfiction.Net</a></li>
              <li><a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="http://www.archiveofourown.org">Archive of Our Own</a>, which is more commonly known as AO3 </li>
              <li><a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></li>
              <li><a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="https://www.wattpad.com/stories/fanfiction">Wattpad</a></li>
              <li><a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="http://www.livejournal.com">Livejournal</a>, however this is no longer a very popular source</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are lesser known forms of fanfiction, but that still fall under the category.
             These are headcanons and parody or role-play social media accounts. "Headcanon" is
          an idea about an aspect of the universe, for example characters, that are not supported
         by the canon, but that a fan enjoys and thinks applies to that aspect. If a headcanon
        is accepted almost universally by the fanbase, it is known as "fanon".</p>
            <p>Parody and role-play accounts exist primarily within the realm of Tumblr and
            Twitter. The purpose of these accounts is to allow fans to write their favorite
           characters, as well as interact with them, without having to write fanfiction. Twitter
          is a popular medium for these accounts as the character limit allows for quick bursts
        of speech or commentary from the character the represent without having to establish context
       or action as is needed in traditional fanfiction.</p>
            <h2 style="color:white">Fanart</h2>
            <p>Like fanfiction, fanart is a highly popular form of fanwork. Fanart is an
            artistic representation of any aspect of a universe that stands out to the artist.
           Fanart is also very versatile. Artists work in digital art, paint, sketches, full-color
          drawings, and other various mediums to create portraits, landscapes, objects, and dynamic
         scenes. Fanart and fanfiction can also co-exist through comics and fanart or fanfiction
        inspired by the other medium. Fanart is easily accessible through Google Images, but to directly
      support an artist, their work can be found on various sites including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="http://www.deviantart.com">DeviantArt</a></li>
              <li>Tumblr</li>
              <li>Twitter</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 style="color:white">Fan-Made Videos</h2>
            <p>Fan-made videos are a bit of an obscure side of a fanbase, but they are still a good
               creative outlet for fans to share their love for a series. However, this medium tends
                to be more limited than fanfiction or fanart. Fan-made videos typically use scenes from
               the films, offical art, or fanart, however the use of fanart in videos is generally frowned upon as
             they usually do not credit or gain permission from the original artist. There are also only two popular
            forms of videos that are used: "crack" videos and music videos. Crack videos are purely created for the
           purpose of humor. The generally combine filmed clips with songs, sound effects, other visuals, or other dialogue
          to make the visual either ironic or funny. Within the Star Wars fanbase, popular crack videos include
         the Bad Lip Reading of the films (which can be found on the Bad Lip Reading <a style="color:mediumslateblue" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BadLipReading">Youtube channel</a>).</p>
            <p>Music videos tend to be a bit more versatile for fan-made videos. This is because
            these videos not only have a wide-range of music selection, but the videos can be made to
          represent the series in general, or focus on single characters or relationships. No two music
         videos are alike as well because even if the same song is used, it can be cut, use different
        scenes, or even represent different characters or themes. Below is an example of one such music video.</p>
        <p>Long video here</p>
            <h2 style="color:white">Meta</h2>
            <p>"Meta" is the fan term for analysis of the series. This analysis can be either long or short and
            deal with any aspect of the series the author of the meta thinks needs to be explored or theorized
           about within the canon of the story. The kind of metas that are written depend on what is established
          within the canon universe. In Star Wars, the most common meta themes are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Theories regarding the new films</li>
            <li>Providing and tying information from the Expanded Universe to the Canon Universe </li>
            <li>"What if" scenarios</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, despite the information and analysis metas provide, not all are trustworthy
           and should sometimes be taken with a grain of salt. In theory meta, for it to be believeable,
          it should always back up its claims with evidence from canon and not be so off the wall that
         it can easily be brushed off and ignored or disproven by current canon (the "Rey is Anakin Skywalker's
          reincarnation" theory is an example of a wild theory that is easily disproven). In metas that
        address the Expanded Universe, while they are interesting, the author and audience needs to
      remember that this information is no longer a part of the true Star Wars canon and can therefore be
     completely and totally scrapped one day by Disney and Lucasfilm Ltd. "What if" scenarios are
   a bit tricky to treat as meta as getting too involved results in more of a fanfiction story than an analysis
  of what would happen in canon if one thing was changed. A good "what if" meta would answer the question
 and analyze how it would effect the given story rather than creating a new story of its own.</p>
          <p>Metas are generally written and published via digital text. They tend to be published
           on sites like Tumblr or Archive of Our Own, however short metas and theories can be found
          on Twitter. Metas can also be published on Youtube as videos by combining a voice over with still images
         or clips without audio.</p>
