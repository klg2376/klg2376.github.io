            <h1 style="color:white">Star Wars History</h1>
            <p>It is reasonable to say that the Star Wars franchise has had a massive effect
              on not only audiences, but on cinema and science fiction films as a whole.
            It is easily recognizable and people who have never seen the films can most likely
          pull out pieces of the films and be relatively accurate. And with new films and media
        being released, the franchise is still having an effect on new generations. Star Wars
      also has been around for nearly forty years (half of which passed between the releases of
      A New Hope and The Phantom Menace), which is plenty of time to build itself as the icon
    it deserves to be.</p>

            <h2 style="color:white">On Special and Sound Effects</h2>
            <p>Audio Recording here</p>
            <p>Star Wars was highly influential when it came to the development of special and sound effects.
            For example, the famous opening crawl was filmed by pulling an angled camera down the sheet
          containing all of the text for the crawl. George Lucas hired special effects expert John Stears to create the
            mechanical and electrical effects and Stears is responsible for the designs of R2-D2, C-3PO, and the famous
          aerial dogfight featured at the end of the film. Lucas also hired sound designer Ben Burtt to create the sound effects.
        Burtt's sound design was innovative, using common sounds to create the famous ones known from the film.
      For example, the lightsaber hum is a combination of an idling projector and television feedback while the
        iconic "pew pew" noise the blasters are famous for is a guy-wire being hit with a hammer. Burtt is also
      credited with creating the infamous "Wilhelm scream" heard when a stormtrooper falls on the Death Star and
    he won an Academy award for Special Acheivement as there was no award for sound design at the time. The score for all
  seven saga films has been composed by John Williams, who will also be composing the score for Episode VIII.</p>
