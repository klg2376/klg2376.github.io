            <h1 style="color:white">The Expanded Universe</h1>
            <p>In April of 2014, following Disney's acquistion of Star Wars from George Lucas
               in 2012, it was announced that a large portion of the Star Wars media produced outside
                of the main films would be a part of a new branch titled "Star Wars Legends" and therefore
                 no longer considered to be a part of the main Star Wars Canon Universe. This material was
               formerly called the Expanded Universe (though it can be said that any media outside of the main
                films is the Expanded Universe, but that is generally terminology that is not used). This decision
               was made to allow for expansion of the Star Wars Universe by Disney without having to worry about
              adapting stories that were previously created.</p>
              <p>However, this decision has complicated what is known as the Canon Universe (or CU) as some aspects
               of the Expanded Universe (or EU or Legends) do not contradict current canon. In order to understand
              exactly how the Legends stories fit into the CU, it needs to be established just what exactly is a part of each
             universe and what blurs lines.</p>
             <p> First, the CU is made up of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All of the main films, consisting of the Prequel Trilogy (Episodes I-III), Original Trilogy (Episodes IV-VI),
               and the Sequel Trilogy (Episodes VII-IX)</li>
              <li>The upcoming anthology films produced by Disney</li>
              <li>The television series "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" and "Star Wars: Rebels"</li>
              <li>Any media produced since the Legends announcement or that deals directly with the films (i.e. novelisations or game adaptations)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Second, the EU consists of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All media produced prior to 2014 that doesn't deal directly with the films or that has not
                 been confirmed as true canon by George Lucas, Lucasfilm Ltd., or Disney</li>
              <li>Media that directly contradicts with true canon</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While this is simple enough, the confusion comes in with Legends material produced
               before 2014 that is not confirmed as canon in anyway, but also does not contradict true
                canon. What of this material can be accepted as still canon and what needs to be
              admitted to no longer be a part of the CU? The best way to determine this is by looking at the material
             chronologically within the universe.</p>
             <p>The earliest stories of the Legends occur thousands of years before the Prequel Trilogy. Therefore,
             it is safe to say that all information prior to The Phantom Menace (with a buffer of approximately 20-50 years)
           can be considered as canon unless new media negates portions of this. The majority of content set during the time of
         the first six films is not canon as there are the films and new media in this timeframe. The only gray
       area here is the 19 years that occur between Episodes III and IV. New media is being produced in this time that
     replaces Legends stories, including the Rogue One and Han Solo films, but some stories, such as the Kenobi novel, are untouched
   currently and can be considered as canon until proven otherwise.</p>
            <p>It is safe to say that all Legends content that takes place following Return of the Jedi is
            no longer canon. The Sequel Trilogy, which begins with The Force Awakens, is creating a new canon
          storyline. Therefore, all Legends content that exists during the time between and during the Sequel Trilogy
        is no longer true to the main universe. The only exception to this is aspects of the Legends stories
      that are being readded to canon, such as Grand Admiral Thrawn, and Legends events that occur several decades or centuries
    following the Sequel Trilogy timeframe. However, this content is not entirely canon as previous events and characters have
  been altered for the new main canon.</p>
